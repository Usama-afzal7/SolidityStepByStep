# Learning Solidity

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Solidity, a high-level, statically-typed, and contract-oriented programming language designed for implementing smart contracts[2][7]. 

## About Solidity

Solidity was introduced in 2014 and has since become the de facto standard for writing smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain[1]. It is influenced by Python, C++, and JavaScript, and runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)[2][7]. 

Smart contracts written in Solidity are responsible for storing all of the programming logic that controls the execution of transactions and the management of an application's state[4]. Solidity supports complex user-defined types, libraries, and inheritance[2][4]. 

## Purpose of This Repository

The main purpose of this repository is to document my daily progress as I learn and practice Solidity. Each day, I will add new files corresponding to the concepts I've learned and the practice programs I've written. 

## What I'll Be Learning

Over the next two weeks, I plan to cover the following topics:

1. First Smart Contract
2. Variables and Data Types
3. Operators and Type Conversions
4. Conditionals
5. Mappings
6. Global Keywords
7. Sending and Recieving Ethers
8. Errors and Exceptions
9. Constructors
10. Self Destruct
11. Events
12. Arrays
13. Strings
14. Looping

I look forward to this journey and invite you to follow along as I delve into the world of Solidity and smart contract development.
